## How to contribute to is.js

* Before you open a ticket or send a pull request, [search](https://github.com/landau/is/issues) for previous discussions about the same feature or issue. Add to the earlier ticket if you find one.

* Before sending a pull request for a feature, be sure to add tests.

* Use the same coding style as the rest of the codebase.

* In your pull request, do not add documentation or re-build the distributed versions. I'll do those things before cutting a new release.
